I’m a Data Analyst with 4+ years of experience using data to support business and customer decision-making. I specialize in SQL, Python, and BI tools like Power BI and ThoughtSpot, with hands-on experience building dashboards, automating reports, and translating complex data into clear insights.

I’ve worked in client-facing and business analytics roles, where I partnered with stakeholders to improve metric visibility, reporting efficiency, and data accuracy. I’m currently pursuing an MS in Data Analytics Engineering at George Mason University and actively building projects in SQL, Power BI, and Python to deepen my analytics and machine learning skills.
