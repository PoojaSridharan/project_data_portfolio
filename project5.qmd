This A/B testing case study by Pooja Sridharan provides a compelling narrative of how data-driven design can significantly impact business revenue. Below is a structured "story" format designed for a professional portfolio or LinkedIn feature.

## 📈 Case Study: Driving Growth Through Data-Driven Design

**Objective:** Evaluate if a redesigned landing page would outperform the existing version in user conversions.

### 🔍 The Business Challenge

In digital products, the landing page is the "moment of truth." My goal was to determine if a new design could move the needle on **conversion rates**, a critical metric for both revenue and user engagement. Before committing to a full-scale launch, we needed to validate that any observed improvements were statistically reliable and not just a product of random chance.

### 🛠️ Experiment Design & Validation

To ensure clean, actionable results, I structured a rigorous experiment:

-   **Sample Size:** Utilized a dataset of approximately **294,000 users** to ensure high statistical power.

-   **Randomization:** Users were split into a **Control Group** (existing page) and a **Treatment Group** (redesign).

-   **Hygiene Checks:** Before analysis, I verified there were no duplicate records and confirmed that randomization successfully balanced demographic attributes like age, gender, and device type.

-   **Metric Selection:** A correlation analysis confirmed that **conversion status** was strongly linked to **purchase amount**, validating conversion rate as the ideal primary metric.

### 📊 Key Findings

The data revealed a clear winner. The redesigned page didn't just perform better—it performed significantly better.

|                               |                             |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Metric**                    | **Results**                 |
| **Control Conversion Rate**   | 11.87%                      |
| **Treatment Conversion Rate** | 17.95%                      |
| **Absolute Lift**             | **+6.08 percentage points** |

### 🧪 Statistical Rigor

To confirm these results, I applied a **two-sample proportion z-test**:

-   **Z-statistic:** -46.28

-   **P-value:** \< 0.001 (Highly significant)

-   **95% Confidence Interval:** \[5.8%, 6.3%\]

Because the entire confidence interval was well above zero, we had strong evidence that the redesign was a "practically meaningful" improvement for the business.

### 💡 Recommendation & Impact

Based on the evidence, I recommended a **full roll-out** of the redesigned landing page. This project demonstrated how a controlled experiment can transform a design hypothesis into a proven revenue driver.
